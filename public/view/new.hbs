               <h5>What is Covid 19?</h5>
               <p>
                Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
                in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
                to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
                severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
                and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
                discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

               <h5>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h5>
               <p>
                The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
                dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
                congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
                usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
                donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about
                80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.
                Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously
                ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with
                underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems
                or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with
                fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

               <h5>How does COVID-19 spread?</h5>
               <p>
                People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
                disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
                the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
                coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around
                the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these
                objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People
                can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person
                with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is
                important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person
                who is sick.
